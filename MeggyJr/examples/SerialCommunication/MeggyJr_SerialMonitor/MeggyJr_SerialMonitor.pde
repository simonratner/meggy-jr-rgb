  MeggyJr_SerialMonitor.pde 
 
 Example file using the The Meggy Jr Simplified Library (MJSL)
 from the Meggy Jr RGB library for Arduino
 
 Test which buttons have been pressed, since last we checked,
using the CheckButtonsPress() routine.


 To see the serial output on your computer, click the "Serial Monitor" 
 button in the Arduino environment; it's the one next to the "Upload to I/O board"
 button. Also, make sure that you have the correct baud rate selected-- 19200.
 The baud rate selection should be visible once you have the serial monitor on.
