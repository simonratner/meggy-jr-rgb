Minesweeper clone for the [Meggy Jr RGB](http://shop.evilmadscientist.com/productsmenu/tinykitlist/100-meggyjr).

Gameplay
--------
Number of surrounding mines at the current cursor position is indicated with
auxiliary LEDs. It is also shown with color, as follows:

      0 - black
      1 - blue
      2 - green
      3 - yellow
      4 - orange
      5 - bright blue
      6 - bright green
      7 - bright yellow
      8 - bright orange

Mines are red, flags are violet, your cursor is white.

Use directional keys to move the cursor, ``A`` to flag and ``B`` to reveal the
current cell. Pressing ``B`` on a revealed cell will also reveal all unflagged
cells around it.
